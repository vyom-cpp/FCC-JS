- > **Comment your JavaScript code**
```js
// This is a single line comment
/* This is a multi-line comment */
```

- > **Declare variables in JavaScript**
```js
// JavaScript provides eight different data types which are,
// undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number & object
 /*Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number & statements are ended by Semicolons (;)*/
var myName;
```

- > **Storing values with assignment operators**
```js
// We can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).
var  myVar;
myVar = 5;
/*First, this code creates a variable names myVar and then assigns value 5 to myVar
Now, if myVar appears again in the code then the program will treat it as 5.*/
```

- > **Assigning a vlue of one variable to another**
```js
var myVar;
myVar = 5;
var myNum;
myNum = myVar;
/*The above declares a myVar variable with no value, then assigns it the value 5. Next, a variable named myNum is declared with no value. Then, the contents of myVar (which is 5) is assigned to the variable myNum. Now, myNum also has the value of 5.*/
```
